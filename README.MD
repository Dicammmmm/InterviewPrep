# Algorithm Solutions Repository

A collection of algorithm and data structure solutions organized by programming patterns. This repository serves as a reference for coding interview preparation and algorithm study as well as preparation for behavioral questions. Includes CV templates and CV advice.

## 🎯 Use Case

This repository is designed for:

- **Interview Preparation**: Quick reference for common coding interview problems
- **Algorithm Study**: Understanding different approaches and their time/space complexities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning to identify problem patterns and apply appropriate solutions
- **Code Review**: Comparing multiple solutions for the same problem
- **Educational Reference**: Teaching and learning fundamental algorithms and data structures

## 🚀 Features

- **Multiple Solutions**: Most problems include 2-3 different approaches with varying time/space complexities
- **Detailed Comments**: Each solution includes inline comments explaining the logic
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity noted for each solution
- **Pattern-Based Organization**: Problems grouped by algorithmic patterns for better learning
- **Interview Focus**: Includes real interview questions from major tech companies (Microsoft, etc.)

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Browse by Pattern**: Navigate to the specific algorithm pattern you want to study
2. **Compare Solutions**: Review multiple approaches for the same problem
3. **Study Complexity**: Understand the trade-offs between different solutions
4. **Practice Implementation**: Use the solutions as reference while practicing

## 🔧 Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Explore the solutions
cd algorithm-solutions
```

## 📋 Solution Format

Each Python solution follows this structure:

```python
# Problem description
# Constraints and requirements

# Time complexity: O(...)
# Space complexity: O(...)
class Solution1:
    def problemName(self, params) -> return_type:
        # Implementation with detailed comments
        pass

# Alternative approach with different complexity
class Solution2:
    def problemName(self, params) -> return_type:
        # Alternative implementation
        pass
```
